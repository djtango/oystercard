# Makers Academy: Oystercard

## Introduction:

There is one class in this project:
  Oystercard.

  Oystercard contains the following methods:
    ```
    *top_up
    *deduct
    *balance
    *in_journey
    *touch_in
    *touch_out
    ```

## Challenge 09:
  `touch_in` will fail if balance is below the `MINIMUM_FARE` (1Â£)

## Challenge 10:
  `touch_out` will trigger `deduct`ion of `MINIMUM_FARE`
  `deduct` method is passive and can therefore be made private.
  Unit test involving `deduct` needs updating to reflect that.
